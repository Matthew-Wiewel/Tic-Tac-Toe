This is a program in Java for playing Tic-Tac-Toe via a GUI.

Currently I am working on getting the AI to make a decision within a reasonable time on expert difficulty with a 4x4 or 5x5 board. (These changes will be taken to TuneAIattempt2.) There are also some minor GUI changes still to be made with pause transitions.
