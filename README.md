This is a program in Java for playing Tic-Tac-Toe via a GUI.

Currently I am working on getting the AI to make a decision within a reasonable time on expert difficulty with a 4x4 or 5x5 board. (Branch the next steps for that to be held on TBD as the TuneAI branch is currently a dead end that has instead of speeding up the AI decision, made it take longer at lower skill levels on smaller boards.) There are also some minor GUI changes still to be made with pause transitions.
